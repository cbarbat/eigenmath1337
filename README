This is eigenmath with a Pratt parser.

The variable pratt controls the parser and is initialized to the value 1.
That means that the Pratt parser is used by default.
If you want to use the recursive descent parser, you need to set:
pratt = 0.

To build and run under Linux or other Unix-type OS:

	cd src
	make
	./eigenmath

Press control-C to exit.

To run a script:

	./eigenmath scriptfilename

Sample scripts are available at www.eigenmath.org

Additionally, there is an EigenMath.sln file for the Visual Studio IDE.
It contains two projects, which make it possible to compile eigenmath with a Windows GUI and for the Windows console.
