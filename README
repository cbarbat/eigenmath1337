"I have often felt that programming is an art form,
 whose real value can only be appreciated
 by another versed in the same arcane art;
 there are lovely gems and brilliant coups
 hidden from human view and admiration, sometimes forever,
 by the very nature of the process."

 Ed Nather, The Story of Mel

Calin Barbat: There is also a Visual Studio solution file:

	EigenMath.sln

It uses old GUI code from Eigenmath137 together
with the newest Eigenmath code from George Weigt.

Calin added a Pratt parser to this code base.

To use the Pratt parser, issue this command at the
Eigenmath prompt:

	pratt=1

To switch back to the recursive descent parser instead:

	pratt=0
