To build and run in a Unix type environment:

	cd src
	make
	./eigenmath

Press control-C or type exit to exit.

To run a script:

	./eigenmath scriptfilename

Sample scripts are available at www.eigenmath.org

To generate LaTeX output:

	./eigenmath --latex scriptfilename >foo.tex

To generate MathML output:

	./eigenmath --mathml scriptfilename >foo.html

To generate MathJax output:

	./eigenmath --mathjax scriptfilename >foo.html

MathML and MathJax results look best on Firefox.

There is also a Visual Studio solution file:

	EigenMath.sln

It uses old GUI code from Eigenmath137 together
with the newest Eigenmath code from George Weigt.

I added a Pratt parser to this code base.

To use the Pratt parser, issue this command at the
Eigenmath prompt:

	pratt(1)

To switch back to the recursive descent parser instead:

	pratt(0)
