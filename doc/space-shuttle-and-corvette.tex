\subsection{Space shuttle and Corvette}
The space shuttle accelerates from zero to 17{,}000 miles per hour
in 8 minutes.
A Corvette accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds.
The following script compares the two.

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom=\color{blue},samepage=true]
vs = 17000*"mile"/"hr"
ts = 8*"min"/(60*"min"/"hr")
as = vs/ts
as
vc = 60*"mile"/"hr"
tc = 4.5*"sec"/(3600*"sec"/"hr")
ac = vc/tc
ac
"Time for Corvette to reach orbital velocity:"
vs/ac
vs/ac*60*"min"/"hr"
\end{Verbatim}

Here is the result when the script runs.
It turns out that the space shuttle accelerates more than twice as fast as a
Corvette.

$\displaystyle a_s={\hbox{127500 mile}\over(\hbox{hr})^2}$

$\displaystyle a_c={\hbox{48000 mile}\over(\hbox{hr})^2}$

\verb$Time for Corvette to reach orbital velocity:$

$\displaystyle 0.354167\;\rm hr$

$\displaystyle 21.25\;\rm min$
