\section{Tricks}
\begin{enumerate}

\item
The last result is stored in the symbol \verb$last$.

\item
In a script, setting \verb$trace=1$
causes each line to be printed just before it is evaluated.
Useful for debugging.

\item
Use \verb$contract(A)$ to get the mathematical trace of matrix \verb$A$.

\item
Calculations in a script can span multiple lines.
The trick is to arrange things so the parser will keep going.
For example, if a calculation ends with a plus sign, the parser will go to the next line to get another term.
Also, the parser will keep going when it expects a close parenthesis.

\item
Use \verb$binding(s)$ to get the unevaluated binding of symbol \verb$s$.

\item
Use \verb$s=quote(s)$ to clear symbol \verb$s$.

\item
Use \verb$float(pi)$ to get the floating point value of $\pi$.

\end{enumerate}
