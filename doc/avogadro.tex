\subsection{Avogadro's constant}
There is a proposal to define Avogadro's constant as exactly
84446886 to the third power.
(Fox, Ronald and Theodore Hill.
``An Exact Value for Avogadro's Number.''
{\it American Scientist} 95 (2007): 104--107.)
The proposed number in the article is actually $(84446888)^3$.
In a subsequent addendum the authors reduced it to $84446886^3$ to make the
number divisible by 12. (See {\tt www.physorg.com/news109595312.html}.)
This number corresponds to an ideal cube of atoms with 84,446,886
atoms along each edge.
Let us check the difference between the proposed value and the measured value
of $(6.0221415\pm0.0000010)\times10^{23}$ atoms.

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom=\color{blue},samepage=true]
A = 84446886^3
B = 6.0221415*10^23
A-B
\end{Verbatim}

$\displaystyle -5.17173\times10^{16}$

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom=\color{blue},samepage=true]
0.0000010*10^23
\end{Verbatim}

$\displaystyle 1\times10^{17}$

We see that the proposed value is within the experimental error.
Just for the fun of it, let us factor the proposed value.

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom=\color{blue},samepage=true]
factor(A)
\end{Verbatim}

$\displaystyle 2^3\times3^3\times1667^3\times8443^3$
