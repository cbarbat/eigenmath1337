\subsection{Quantum harmonic oscillator}
For total energy $E$, kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $V$ we have
$$E=K+V$$
The corresponding formula for a quantum harmonic oscillator is
$$(2n+1)\psi=-{d^2\psi\over dx^2}+x^2\psi$$
where $n$ is an integer and represents the quantization of energy values.
The solution to the above equation is
$$\psi_n(x)=\exp(-x^2/2)H_n(x)$$
where $H_n(x)$ is the $n$th Hermite polynomial in $x$.
The following Eigenmath code checks $E=K+V$ for $n=7$.

\begin{Verbatim}[formatcom=\color{blue},samepage=true]
n = 7
psi = exp(-x^2/2)*hermite(x,n)
E = (2*n+1)*psi
K = -d(psi,x,x)
V = x^2*psi
E-K-V
\end{Verbatim}
